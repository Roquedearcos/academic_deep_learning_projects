# 🧠 Academic Deep Learning Projects

This repository contains a set of academic projects developed during the *Neural Networks and Deep Learning* course as part of my AI Engineering degree.

Each folder is an independent project that explores a different deep learning technique using PyTorch, covering models such as CNNs, GANs, and Transformers.

## 📂 Projects Overview

### `project01_CNN`
Image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Includes transfer learning with pretrained models such as ResNet or VGG on ImageNet.

### `project02_transformers`
Sequence-to-sequence model using Transformers to sort natural language representations of numbers.


### `project03_GAN`
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for generating handwritten digits (MNIST). Includes conditional generation based on class labels.
